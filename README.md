#Virtual Background Replacement
Virtual background replacement is a popular computer vision application where the background of a video stream (typically from a webcam) is removed and replaced with a custom image or video. This effect is widely used in video conferencing tools like Zoom. Using Python and OpenCV, you can implement this functionality with several approaches, ranging from traditional background subtraction to advanced AI-based segmentation.
